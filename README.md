# Hahn Application

### Instructions
* Please make sure to change the IIS to Hahn.ApplicationProccess.Application on Visual Studio to have it run on Kestrel.
* With initial startup, one applicant will be inserted automatically to the in-memory. When the application runs, it will return that applicant or you can check the ApplicantGenerator.cs file and find it. 
* After running both client and server side, use client side to register new applicants. (Client side runs on port number 8081)
